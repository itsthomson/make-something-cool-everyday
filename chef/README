Purpose:
This program will prompt the user to input a positive number. The program will then find all primes strictly less than that number and print them out. 

This program was written in Chef, yet another esoteric programming language written by David Morgan-Mar. Chef has three design principles:
	
	- Program recipes should not only generate output, but they should 
	be easy to prepare and delicious.
	- Recipes may appeal to cooks with different budgets.
	- Recipes will be metric, but may use traditional cooking measures 
	such as cups and tablespoons.
